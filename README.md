# warping_drives

## Description

This repository contains the code for a simulation of a warp drive.
The warp drive is a concept from science fiction that allows faster-than-light travel.
The simulation is based on the Alcubierre drive, a theoretical model for a warp drive.
See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive) or the [Official Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0009013) for more information.


You can find the simulation in the `data` directory.
In the video, you can see the fabric of spacetime being warped by the warp drive bellow, and the ship moving through in the middle.
At some point, as the ship goes over the speed of light, the bubble collapses (there is a spike).

## Requirements

python >= 3.8

**Setting Up the Environment**

* Windows: `./setup_Windows.bat`
* Linux/macOS: `./setup_Linux.sh`

These scripts will install required dependencies, and build a virtual environment for you if you don't have one.

## Running the Program

### CLI

1. Navigate to the `bin` directory: `cd bin`

2. Execute `python warpdrive.py` (use `python3` on Linux/macOS) in your terminal
